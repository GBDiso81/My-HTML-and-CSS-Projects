<p> &nbsp; Sadly our <span style="color:gold;font-weight:bold;font-size:20px">Golden</span> is nearing the end<br>
But still has a bunch more loving to give<br>
Amazing how they win you over<br>
In the heart where everybody lives<br><br>

&nbsp; Fifteen years of warmth and sunshine<br>
Miss <span style="color:gold;font-weight:bold;font-size:20px">Golden </span>you have turned my crank<br>
Sure wish you could live forever<br>
But in realitsy we have much to thank<br><br>

&nbsp; Sadly our <span style="color:gold;font-weight:bold;font-size:20px">Golden</span> is nearing the end<br>
She's hanging on for our benefit not hers<br>
We should let her go with dignity<br>
And bequeath her charms to her heirs<br>
