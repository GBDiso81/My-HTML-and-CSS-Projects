	<p>The golden retriever is even-tempered, intelligent and affectionate. Golden retrievers are playful, yet gentle with children, and they tend to get along well 		with other pets and strangers.These dogs are eager to please, which probably explains why they respond so well to obedience training and are such 			popular service dogs. They also like to work, whether it involves hunting birds or fetching their guardian's slippers.Golden retrievers are not often 			barkers, and they lack guard instincts, so do not count on them to make good watchdogs. However, some golden retrievers will let you know when strangers 		are approaching.</p>
