		<h1> Type of Dog Breeds </h1>
		<p> The dog is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from a population of wolves during the Late 				Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the development of agriculture.

		<h3>A. Country of Origin :</h3>
			<p> The Golden Retriever is a Scottish breed of retriever dog of medium size. It is characterised by a gentle and affectionate nature and a striking golden 				coat. It is a working dog, and registration is subject to successful completion of a working trial.</p>
		<h3>B. Breed From: </h3>
			<p>The golden retriever breed originated in 1868 when Lord Tweedmouth mated a yellow Wavy-Coated retriever named ‚ÄúNous‚Äù with a Tweed Water spaniel named 				‚ÄúBelle.</p>

		<h3>C. Dog Traits</h3>
			<p>The golden retriever is even-tempered, intelligent and affectionate. Golden retrievers are playful, yet gentle with children, and they tend to get along 				well with other pets and strangers.These dogs are eager to please, which probably explains why they respond so well to obedience training and are such 				popular service dogs. They also like to work, whether it involves hunting birds or fetching their guardian's slippers.Golden retrievers are not often 				barkers, and they lack guard instincts, so do not count on them to make good watchdogs. However, some golden retrievers will let you know when 					strangers are approaching.</p>
